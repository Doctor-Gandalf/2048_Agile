# 2048 Agile Edition

This is a clone of Gabriele Cirulli's game 2048 (https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), playable in terminal.
This game runs on the Agile Engine, and acts as an easy-access demo of what the engine is capable of.


For graphics, it relies upon the Curses library, which limits it to running on Linux and OSX.

Note: this is the original, depreciated version of the game. While I no longer use this repo for the main game, I have used elements of this in the newest version (dubbed the Rogue-Agile engine), and will be keeping this repo up to demonstrate the progress. To see an up-to-date version of this game, please see https://github.com/Doctor-Gandalf/2048_RAE.
